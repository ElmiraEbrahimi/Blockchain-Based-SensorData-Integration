# IOT_Blockchain_Data_Integration

## Overview

The project simulates a reading from a fake sensor (data from the [UMass Smart Dataset*- 2017 release](https://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Smart/Smart), including a wide variety of data collected from real homes) and stores the values on a local blockchain. The user can set filters in a panel to determine what data from this sensor is within the normal range and should be stored in the blockchain, as well as filters for the speed at which data can be read from the sensor or sent to the blockchain.
